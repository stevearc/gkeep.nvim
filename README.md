# Gkeep.nvim

> [!CAUTION]
> I no longer use Google Keep for notes. The lack of an official API has finally caused me enough pain that I am retiring this plugin.

</details>

Post-install, you will need to run `:UpdateRemotePlugins` if your installer
hasn't done so automatically.

`gkeep.nvim` also depends on the `gkeepapi` and `keyring` python libraries. It
will attempt to install those automatically, but if it fails you will need to
find the `python3` executable that neovim is using (if you're not sure, run
`:checkhealth provider`) and run `python3 -m pip install gkeepapi keyring`. If
you are NOT using python 3.8+, you will also need to pip install
`typing-extensions`.

Run `:checkhealth gkeep` to confirm everything is set up properly

**A note about keyring**: \
Keyring is required to store your Google auth token securely. In most cases it
will work automatically, but if you see an error in your `:checkhealth` output,
you may need to fiddle with the setup. See the
[keyring](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) repo for details about the
supported backends. Take note of the special instructions for running on
headless systems or in a docker container if it applies to you. If you
absolutely cannot get any of the supported backends working, you can `pip install keyrings.alt` to use [an insecure
backend](https://github.com/jaraco/keyrings.alt), though this has negative
security implications.

## Setup

No configuration is necessary to get started, simply run `:GkeepLogin`. It will
prompt you for an email and password (if you use 2-factor, you will need to
provide an [app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)).

The API master token is stored using
[keyring](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) so you don't have to enter your
password again. To remove the stored credentials from your system, run
`:GkeepLogout`.

Additionally, there is the function `GkeepStatus()` which returns the current
status message (usually about syncing notes). This can be used in your
statusline if desired.

## Configuration

Set the following global variables to configure gkeep.

| Variable                | Type   | Default                                                                                                 | Description                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `g:gkeep_sync_dir`      | string | `null`                                                                                                  | The directory to sync notes into (see [file sync](#file-sync) below)                                                |
| `g:gkeep_sync_archived` | bool   | `false`                                                                                                 | If `true`, will sync archived notes as well                                                                         |
| `g:gkeep_nerd_font`     | bool   | `true`                                                                                                  | When `true`, will use icons from your [patched font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)                                    |
| `g:gkeep_icons`         | dict   | See [config.py](https://github.com/stevearc/gkeep.nvim/blob/master/rplugin/python3/gkeep/config.py#L26) | Override the icons used                                                                                             |
| `g:gkeep_width`         | int    | 32                                                                                                      | Set the width of the sidebar                                                                                        |

Note that these variables must be set _before_ gkeep is loaded in order for them
to take effect.

## Features

### Menu

![Screenshot from 2021-07-30 16-19-20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506791/127720445-50753c53-a5f7-4690-8729-5798a208e756.png)

The Menu is the top window that displays your labels and searches. Use `?` to
view all the keymaps available. The main features include:

- Search your notes
- Save/edit/delete searches
- Create/edit/delete labels

### Note list

![Screenshot from 2021-07-30 16-22-56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506791/127720583-e2a3b1a1-87f0-4819-97c2-565297871f78.png)

The Note list is the bottom window that displays the notes that match the
currently-selected menu item (label, search, etc). Use `?` to view all the
keymaps available. The main features include:

- Open notes
- Archive or delete notes
- Create new notes
- Change the note type or color
- Change the sort order

### Note editing

Notes will have the title, id, and labels at the top like so:

```markdown
# My note

id: 1626733972853.1206798729
labels: First label, Another label
```

To change the note title, simply edit the file and `:w`. The same goes for
labels. If the note doesn't have any labels yet, manually add the `labels:` line
and they will be picked up when you save. Do not change the `id:` line.

There is an omnicomplete function (`<C-x><C-o>`) that will complete the labels
for you

**Note**: if you are using [file sync](#file-sync), renaming files _will not_
rename the note. Changing the note title _will_ rename the file.

#### Lists

Google Keep has a special type of note to represent lists, and gkeep customizes
the editing environment heavily to enforce the proper format. You may wish to
bind `:GkeepCheck` to a convenient keymap.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506791/127721475-6bf500ac-e5e6-49b4-9886-1ece02cfead8.mp4

### Links

You can embed links to other notes within a note. The format for a link is
`[visible text](note_id)`. You can quickly get a link to a note using the
`:GkeepYank` command. To jump to a link under your cursor, use the `:GkeepGoto`
command (bound to `gf` by default).

You can also use the [ephemeral url](#ephemeral-notes) format for links if you
like (e.g. `gkeep://{id}/{visible_text}`)

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506791/127722474-3157ef5c-3413-4675-992c-d317ed68ca48.mp4

### Search

Searching notes is done from the [Menu](#menu). Pressing `/` in the menu will
pop open the search prompt. As you type, the [Note list](#note-list) should
live-update to show the search results.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506791/127722820-b0c74d89-e844-4dc2-b81b-4917f22dd579.mp4

The search is case-insensitive, and will look for matches in the note title and
text. Matching is exact, not fuzzy.

#### Flags

There is a special syntax to let you filter notes by type. Notes can be
`[p]inned`, `[a]rchived`, or `[t]rashed`. You can use the following flags to
specify the desired behavior:

- `-`: Exclude notes of the specified type
- `+`: Include notes of the specified type
- `=`: Only show notes of the specified type

```
╭─────────────╮
│🔍 -p        │  // Exclude pinned notes from the search
╰─────────────╯
╭─────────────╮
│🔍 =a        │  // Only search archived notes
╰─────────────╯
╭─────────────╮
│🔍 +at       │  // Search all notes, including archived and trashed
╰─────────────╯
```

The default query functions like `-at`, to filter out archived and trashed
notes.

Flags can be added to any part of the query. Gkeep will search for any text that
is not the flag.

```
╭─────────────╮
│🔍 +a vim +t │  // Search all notes (including archived and trashed) for 'vim'
╰─────────────╯
```

#### Labels and colors

You can search for notes with a specific label or color by using `label:<label>`
and `color:<color>`. This can be abbreviated as `l:<label>` and `c:<color>`. To
specify multiple labels or colors, separate them with a comma.

```
╭────────────────────────╮
│🔍 l:software,journal   │  // Search notes with either label
╰────────────────────────╯
╭────────────────────────╮
│🔍 c:red,blue           │  // Search red and blue notes
╰────────────────────────╯
```

If your label has whitespace or special characters, you can quote it. Note that
you cannot comma-separate quoted labels, so to search multiple you will need to
provide `label:` multiple times.

```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────╮
│🔍 l:"journal entries" l:"project ideas"  │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

You do not need to specify the entire label in a query, only a unique prefix.
For example, if you have the labels `software`, `vim`, and `journal`, you could
search for the software label with `l:s`, since no other labels start with "s".

#### Examples

Some more query examples:

- `vim l:software +a` - Search for `vim` among notes with the `software` label,
  including archived notes
- `code outline l:software,vim c:red` - Search red notes with either a
  `software` or `vim` label that contain the text "code outline"

### Ephemeral notes

The default operation for gkeep is to _not_ save your files to disk. The note
data will be cached locally in a json file (under neovim's cache directory), but
no note files will exist directly. Notes are accessed by using a buffer name
that looks like `gkeep://{id}/{title}.keep`. These buffers can be edited and
saved like a normal file, and they will sync those changes to Google Keep.

### File sync

If you set `let g:gkeep_sync_dir = '~/notes'` gkeep will write all your notes to
that directory and attempt to keep them in sync. It will also scan that
directory for new files and create notes in Google Keep for them. Note files
must use the `.keep` extension to be detected (or `.norg` if using
[Neorg](#neorg)).

#### Merge conflicts

If the Google Keep servers and your local files disagree about the content of a
note, the file on your computer will be renamed to `<filename>.local` and the
original file will be updated to the server latest. When a `.local` file is
present, the note will appear with a red "merge" icon in the list:

![Screenshot from 2021-07-30 16-23-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506791/127720627-d6cdfe97-6480-44c0-8baf-2b840a58fc9b.png)

If you open the note, it will open in a vimdiff split. Resolve the merge
conflict and then delete the `.local` file to get back to a good state.

#### Changing files outside of vim

You can make edits to the synced note files outside of vim, and the changes will
be picked up and synced the next time you open vim (and start gkeep). To protect
you from data loss, when gkeep detects changes that are made from outside of
vim, a backup of the note will be made in Google Keep before uploading those
changes. Backups will appear in your Trash (and thus will be deleted after 7
days), and will have `[Backup]` in the title.

## Third-party integrations

### Telescope

If you have
[telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) installed,
you can use it to search and select your notes. There are two pickers
that you can use:

- `:Telescope gkeep` - Search for and open a note
- `:Telescope gkeep link` - Search for a note and insert a link to it
  at the current cursor position (see [links](#links))

Additionally, each of these pickers can be configured to use a different
type of search. The two options are:

- `"all_text"` - Searches the title and contents of all notes and uses
  the same query syntax as the [search](#search) function. With this
  method, the searching happens in a thread in python and asynchronously reports
  results to telescope, which does a minimal amount of sorting.
- `"title"` - Searches only the titles of notes. With this method,
  telescope fetches the note titles from the python process and
  sorts/filters like usual.

```lua
require("telescope").setup({
  -- You can optionally configure the search method for each of the pickers.
  -- Below are the default values.
  extensions = {
    gkeep = {
      find_method = "all_text",
      link_method = "title",
    },
  },
})
-- Load the extension
require('telescope').load_extension('gkeep')
```

### Neorg

If you have [neorg](https://github.com/vhyrro/neorg) installed, gkeep will
automatically enable support for it (check that it's working with `:checkhealth gkeep`). You will then be able to use the [note list](#note-list) to create
Neorg notes or change existing notes to be Neorg notes. Gkeep will interact
minimally with the `@document.meta` tag, but otherwise it will simply function
as a storage backend for your notes.

**@document.meta** \
gkeep cares about three entries in the document meta:

- `title:` This will be used as the title of the note.
- `categories:` Gkeep will look for labels in here. Note that the [neorg
  spec](https://github.com/vhyrro/neorg/blob/main/docs/NFF-0.1-spec.md#data-tags)
  specifies that categories are _space_-separated. Gkeep will handle it if
  your labels have spaces in them. You can also add categories here that are
  _not_ Google Keep labels and gkeep will ignore them.
- `gkeep:` Gkeep stores the ID of the note here. Do not remove it or you will
  end up creating duplicate notes.

Changing the `title:` and `categories:` will edit the note title and labels,
just like for a normal note.

### Q: Why Google Keep?

It has a good mobile UI. I like editing notes in vim on my desktop, but I also
want to be able to access them on my phone.

### Q: Why not use the official Google Keep API?

Google has recently released an [official API for Google
Keep](https://developers.google.com/keep/api). Since gkeep.nvim has roughly two
different modes of operation, let's evaluate it for each:

- **With notes synced as files:** The API has no concept of 'versions' or delta
  updates like gkeepapi. This means that in order to keep the files in sync,
  we would have to check every single one of them against the cloud version on
  startup. This is prohibitively time consuming and wasteful of CPU and
  bandwidth.
- **With ephemeral notes, no files:** On the surface the API should be great for
  this, but it is lacking key features that we want. The biggest missing
  pieces are search and labels, without which we would have no way to navigate
  notes except scrolling down a list.

If the API gets updated in the future to better support one or both of these
workflows, I'll consider migrating to it.

### Q: What Google Keep features are not supported?

These are Google Keep features that are currently unsupported by gkeep.

## Troubleshooting

### Trouble logging in

**Symptom:** When you try to `:GkeepLogin` a browser window is opened and hangs on "one
moment please...".

**Action:** You are probably trying to log in with a password instead of an _app
password_. Create an [app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) and use that instead. See #7 for details.
